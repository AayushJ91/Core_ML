# ML Projects Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning projects repository. This contains projects I am working on as part of two learning tracks:

1. **Monthly Plan** – Projects aimed at building skills for high-paying AI/ML roles 
2. **Weekly Plan** – Projects and experiments aimed at preparing and deepening my understanding of ML concepts.

Each project is organized in its respective folder with code, datasets, models, and explanations.

## 📂 Directory Structure
