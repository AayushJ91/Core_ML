# Weekly ML Projects - GSoC 2026 Preparation

This folder contains projects designed to strengthen my foundational understanding of ML algorithms and prepare for competitive coding, internships, and open-source contributions.

## Projects

1. **Linear Regression (from scratch)**
   - Built without using libraries like scikit-learn.

2. **Logistic Regression (from scratch)**
   - Focused on binary classification and gradient descent.

3. **Titanic Classification**
   - Used multiple classification algorithms to predict survival.

4. **Spam Classifier**
   - Email classification with dataset balancing using SMOTE.

5. **Ensemble Learning for Card Fraud Detection**
   - Used ensemble methods to handle imbalanced fraud datasets.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed along with libraries like numpy, pandas, scikit-learn.

## 📦 Notes

These projects emphasize algorithm implementation and dataset augmentation techniques to solve real-world problems.
